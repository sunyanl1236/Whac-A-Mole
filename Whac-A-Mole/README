Description:
Programmed a 1 player java game using GUI, multi-thread and event listener in JAVA
Featured animation of moles lighting up and disappearing when the user whack them
Included points counter and sounds when the user smacks a mole

Still working on:
The change of mole image when the user hit the mole
The change of hammer image when the user click

Bug:
Cannot change the cursor size in Windows, the cursor is always 32*32 pixel
Will show two overlapped mole images at a time
